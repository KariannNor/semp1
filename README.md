## Description

Welcome to the Community Science Museum Website Project! This project aims to create an interactive and informative website for the Community Science Museum, a new science museum opening in our town/city. The primary target audience for this website is primary and middle school children aged 7 to 15, as well as families with young children. Our goal is to design a website that not only appeals to youngsters but also engages their parents, recognizing their curiosity and intelligence.

## Project Objectives

- Create an informative and appealing website that attracts both middle school pupils and parents.
- Maintain a balance between being engaging for children and informative for parents.
- Encourage visitors to explore the museum in person.
